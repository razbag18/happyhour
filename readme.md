This second project was my first foray into building a full-stack database backed application. This application was built in a Sinatra app and utilizes SQL to create a database table structure where I can interact with my relationally-stored data. 

You can view my database table diagram [here](https://github.com/razbag18/happyhour/blob/master/public/flowchart/Screen%20Shot%202018-07-27%20at%209.49.59%20am.png)

### What is a CRUD app? 
In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (as an acronym CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 

My application lets the user create new special posts, comments and register as a user. Read allows users to navigate around the site and retrieve data but not cause any other effects. Users can update existing specials in the event the special changes in some way. Delete in this sense is executed when a user logs out of their session. 

### Extensions and oversights:
 #### Extensions:
 1. I am really happy with my landing page and my post new special page. What I'm not happy with is my page where I list all of the specials avaliable on that day.


 Comment edit



I haven't accounted for venue having multiple specials on different days.
